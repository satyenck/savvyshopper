SavvyShopper project files
This project was conceptualized by Satyen Kansara and Balaji Prasad. Satyen architected, designed, implemented some parts of the code  
and oversaw execution by a team of engineers.
Balaji handled product features and marketing. This app was published in Google playstore and Apple iTunes and stayed online for 
a year with 10K+ downloads with very little marketing. Eventually it had to be folded down due to other engagements and commitments 
by Satyen and Balaji.
